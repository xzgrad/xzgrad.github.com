   A history of modern brokenness—So many different things
have been written about the evils of modernity, or the crisis of
our situation. Both on left and right many, maybe most, feel
something has gone terribly wrong. Even those who love some
aspects of the new age, like technology, look away from our
banal time and instead hope for a futuristic flourishing that is
not yet here. I’m a little tired of all this! I don’t want to just
repeat more aspersions of modernity, which many of you
already know. Most of these are footnotes or commentaries to
Nietzsche’s Prologue from Zarathustra, where he describes
the Last Man. The Last Man has been wrongly confused for
the bourgeois, though Nietzsche says it’s something much
worse. Houellebecq, whose explanations of the sexual problem
of modernity, of the incel —all of these explanations are
amazing and true, but even he is just following Nietzsche. If
you want to understand true problem of our time, you can read
that, then, and I won’t dwell on it. I want only to deal with one
particular case of domestication, brokenness, of potentially
high life that has been thwarted, to illustrate modern problem.
The peculiar “history” of how the queen develops, the modern
effeminate homosexual, is very telling. The problem of the
modern homosexual is revealing because it is the model
according to which many other kinds of higher life have been
thwarted and warped into something else. Don’t be fooled by
propagandists: the modern homo has nothing to do with
ancient “predatory bisexuality” or with the pederastic rites
found in many societies. On one hand such people as the
modern queen have always existed but on the other, there are
many specimens now who become this, who would not have
before. It is very unfortunate event in life of animal. Camille
Paglia says that the modern homosexual is the product of the
pressures of post-industrial life. Her model for this is that a
very sensitive young boy, open to aesthetic experience of all
kinds, maybe the kind of slightly neurotic and artistic boy that
a century ago would have experienced synaesthesia; such boy
is turned off by the horseplay and “rough” masculinity of his
brothers and father and other boys his age. The distancing
from this masculinity is concurrent with his becoming over-
close with his mother, idolizing the feminine: upon puberty,
the distance or fear from masculinity leads him to eroticize it,
while he turns away from women, either because of too much
familiarity, or too much awe. In this she is only half right, and
the other half of the story I discovered from an alien mind
whose teachings have been spread among some of the frogs.
His name Harro MJ, but I think this is false name. I tell some
of his ideas here as best I understood. He tells I believe his
own story, or someone he knows: he tells of how modern
world corrupted his nature through stricture and turned him
into a homo. But I think his story speaks to many others, who
didn’t turn into ghey, but who have nevertheless been
disfigured in some other way… by the same force. Now,
Paglia’s restatement of Freud is correct, but she misses an
important element of the story, which is why such a boy turns
away from the masculinity of his peers in the first place. It is
not horseplay or the roughness of male competition as such
that makes him turn away, but the utterly fake or artificial
character of such displays, usually, in our time. Such boy
perceives what his peers don’t, the conditional and entirely
dependent character of life in our age. It is not the masculinity,
the competition for status among men, the physical roughness,
that makes him turn away… but the fact that all such play is
happening in already owned space. It is this aspect of our time
that is crucial to understand. When I speak of something like
owned space, it must not remain mere word. When you
understand something: I mean you must see and feel it like
you would a landscape you know from youth, how to navigate
all its nooks, the different heights of earth, the banks of
streams, where the trees are and how it feels inside them, how
long it takes walking from this or that group of beech to the
abandoned factory, so that the map is already in your body.
This is only way to really understand something. I believe boy
like this is one of the types that sees through the charade the
lords of lies have dangled in front, the shadow-play to dazzle
the many, and he is turned off, maybe not by manliness, but
the buffoonish, deluded character of modern masculinity. The
defeated male that is turned into a peon and a neutered beast
for women and hidden masters is a terrible thing to see. The
jockeying for status, the physical fights, the adventures boys
are supposed to have in a state of nature…all of this is in
nature meant as preparation for life, for a life of conquest and
expansion. Roman teenagers of patrician class were sent
already on missions on behalf of Empire abroad. Modern adult
Western male seeks permission to watch other men playing
sports, quaff vegetable oil relish, beg for “coochie” in
simulated intercourse, masturbation with plastic on dick.
Precisely a character born for conquest, for expansion, a
precocious type of boy who seeks real development and the
real domination of the space around him, who understands in
his blood that play and manliness are to this end, precisely
such a boy will have his expectations about life crushed and
thwarted as soon as his eyes open. This may be around the age
of six or seven, but it sometimes happens earlier. Such boy
then comes to have only contempt for those among his peers
who, not seeing the subjection we are in, continue under their
delusion and accept the breaking that the lords of shadows
begin on the human spirit around this age of awakening—by
nine or ten, the “education” is almost already complete in our
time. They submit to the yoke and their sham simulated
masculinity is now a parody of the true manliness, which in a
state of ascent develops into the will to actually dominate
space around oneself, not into a caricature for the benefit of
women. But this domination is not possible when space is
already owned. This intuition of owned space comes on one
very early: with eyes open, it’s like an evil spirit inhabits
everything. I think there are many types of energetic and
perceiving boys who reach this stage, who are turned off by
the moral and biological self-castration of their conventional
peers, who sense the suffocating limitations of modern space.
The rest of this story is more particular to the boy who as
response becomes a homo or trap, and Paglia is right about
that part—masculinity rejected simply because of distance
from other boys in general, mostly as a result of a certain
native over-sensitivity. But then there is the added observation
that when, late in adolescence or some time in youth, such boy
decides he is “gay,” that is but the final act of self-
misunderstanding. The drama of his spirit is reinterpreted on
sexual terms. He has convinced himself that the feeling of
suppression and dread that had accompanied him his whole
life was because his sexual desires or “sexuality” had been
repressed by “society.” He forgets how these sexual desires
developed in the first place, that these desires themselves were
a circuitous result of the truth that dawned on him in silence,
the truth of the utter subjection and domestication of the space
in which he found himself. In becoming “gay” he believes he
is escaping that sense of primal limitation and subjection that
he felt as a small boy: he has reinterpreted his entire drama as
a maudlin story of sexuality suppressed or oppressed by
retrograde social and political norms. In this he becomes an
unwitting pawn himself of the very power that as a young boy
he had intuited to be the enemy, the great and suffocating
shadow of our time, that smothers all higher life out. The gay
is the spiritual foot-soldier of the new regime, when he is born
to be its enemy. This is the unusual part of this realization, that
some of the most sensitive and perceptive youths, those maybe
imbued with spark of inspiration and a conquering, expanding
spirit, end up becoming the vanguard of that which has
smothered and broken them. In a previous age they wouldn’t
have been gay at all in the first place. The story of such boy is
story of all higher types in our time. Not all gays are of this
origin—there is Jeffrey Dahmer, there are others. And of
course not all higher types become gay, only a tiny minority.
But all higher types in our age are afflicted by a similar drama
of the spirit—what happens later, the sexualization of this
alienation particular to this case, I use only as the most vivid
example. Now in all this you see this idea of space or territory
that is already closed and owned. And this brings up the
question of who or what this force is. I think the answer to this
problem isn’t so simple, but one feature of this new condition
in modern age is that the masters are hidden. That is even why
this condition of subjection seems so suffocating, because they
hide, and so there is no opportunity for open and manly
challenge. This problem is then to be understood through
example of a different type…and I mean that of the spook.
Vivid and instructive is the matter of the gay underworld,
which no longer really exists in our time. But in the 1950’s and
a little before then, when the system of global tyranny was
being firmly erected, it should not be a surprise from
everything that has been said, that the gay underworld was the
“negative” of the new world order, its sieve and pressure
valve. The gay underworld was part of “the remainder.” The
phenomenon of “homosexuality” in the modern world reaches
up to the most profound of political and social problem: it was
always the ghost world, the underworld left over that the
engineers of our time couldn’t manage or account for in the
erection of the Leviathan. This underworld included far more
than the gays of that time, of course: that’s the point. But the
gays formed a kind of “bulk population” that allowed an easy
bridge between this world and ours. They made it far more
permeable to others as well: if you had girlfriend, maybe artsy
girlfriend, she had ghey friend; you could go with them to
lounge of this half-world, and there would be there…maybe
two social contacts removed…there would…one of them. But
now that this world has disappeared, you have no easy way of
even knowing where to start. Its boundaries were policed, its
entry points were surveilled, but it always existed as a space of
freedom outside the pervasiveness of domestication in post-
industrial civilization. Let’s not forget, I repeat, that the “gay
underworld” was hardly just the gays, but precisely that world
penetrated by all types of deviants, perverts, whores, pimps,
impresarios, night club owners, mafia, gangsters, spooks,
intelligence services of all kinds—just see the Dark Ocean
Society and you will understand. The Dark Ocean Society of
Japan is the key to understanding all modern political and
social organization because underneath the pervasiveness of
the domestication and management of modern civilization,
underneath its superficial orderliness, there remained the
“floating world,” the free world as a still and dark ocean in
which moved monsters, including the lords and crafters of this
new civilization themselves. They still live in that world, not
in ours. Our world is the house of subjection, they live in the
estate of freedom and power. It is only that, with the relatively
large number of gays that exist, this world was much larger
than it is now, and more varied, its entry points more
penetrable. The space of night that gays created for
themselves, in which such types could at least feel they had
new opportunity to expand and act, was nuked in the 1980’s
with AIDS first of all, and then at the same time with the “gay
rights” and “gay identity” movement, through which they
came “into the open,” and became the worst and most
merciless enforcers of the global slave state. But enough about
them: you must understand! I use this as illustrative and true
example of what happens to all higher types in our time. The
vast majority don’t become gay, but the plight of the gay is the
most simple and therefore instructive example of this. Anyone
born with a will to conquest and expansion, any specimen born
to courage and the expansion of boundaries, will feel thwarted
now, will awaken at a young age to find themselves in a world
pervaded by an evil and smothering shadow that seeks to blot
out their spirit and break them. How one responds to this…
that is different. And the responses are various. Look at litter
of pups, of whatever species, some will be inquisitive, playful,
seek to experiment, to push boundaries, to leave gaze of
parents and the old, to conquer space; others will be far more
docile and will lack curiosity. The only ones who survive the
modern education “whole,” not to speak of the regime of
modern medication, are precisely those in the litter who are
born docile. And more to the point; who can look at the
beaten-down males of today and think that a boy who inside
him has the spark of conquering spirit won’t have anything but
disgust for their clownish parody of masculinity! What matters
here is which way the spirit turns, and if it can survive the
obstacle course of domestication that modern life and the
modern education imposes on the best. “Homosexuality” in
our age, in any case, is unlike any behavior in the past: as a
total phenomenon, it represents one of the characteristic ways
that some of the most unusual specimens respond to
domestication and are broken by it. Modern homosexuality is
a form of vacuum behavior and stereotypy

      The first thing that drug addiction teaches psychoanalysis is that the object is a semblance, not a substance. It is precisely in drug addiction that we can find the most strongly sustained effort to incarnate the object of jouissance in an object of the world. It is precisely here that it may be verified that the object is semblance, and that on the horizon, the true object of jouissance—if that word means anything—is death.

As some who engaged in incest (jerking off with step brother) this goes incredibly #hard</p>

          <p class="formatted-text">That incesident shaped my pubertal sexuality making me believe i was a fag depsite my attractions to girls prior, which never ceased throughout my life.</p>

          <p class="formatted-text">Caught in the cycle of shame, repression, and eventual "acceptance," I adopted a gay tm identity - which never fit*. Yet it was the only frame that made sense of the sexual trauma.</p>

          <p><strong>Comment section:</strong></p>

          <p class="formatted-text">Yeah, how come u were sucking and fucking men then if u werent a fag?</p>

          <p class="formatted-text">Part of it was cope, as i said. Another part was the effect of the early experience, molding libido like clay, hence dick gets hard. The silver lining of it all, is that I am able to experience sexuality across spectrum untamed and unrestrained, without capitulating and succumbing to the fake and delusional lifestyle of a gay,bi or any other pathological sexual id.</p>

          <p class="formatted-text">Sexual orientation is fake and gay on its own and a made up modern phenomena, there is only one orientation, aligned with nature, god or whatever u wanna name the source.</p>

          <p class="formatted-text">Desire is fluid, thruth aint.</p>

          <p class="formatted-text">In the words of my wife and other close friends who knew me in the midst of my trooning out:</p>

          <p class="formatted-text">- y cant u just be bi, u are clearly just getting back into the closet.</p>

          <p class="formatted-text">I may never be your hetero normie guyTM, slapping his wife and jugging bear with fellas after factory work. But what i can do is be #me (no matter how gay that sounds), and that my dear wife, means choosing not to engage and act upon those desires. Not out of shame, not out of fear but because by grace of god , the expansion of consciousness, i now i understand their origin.</p>

          <p class="formatted-text">U know me the best, remember how you pointed out to me, as we sat at some park, summer night, under trees:</p>

          <p class="formatted-text">- Look Vladimir, see those people? [A group of artsy faggots and trannies gathered for some photoshoot, some of whom i even knew].
Why don't you go play with the fags?</p>

          <p class="formatted-text">I instinctively felt, that you were right to encourage me, to come out of my shell. But i loathed the idea, couldn't see anything in them I could relate to, had zero interest in getting to know, let alone fucking any one of those pretencious arttards.</p>

          <p class="formatted-text">- I nah, i feel exhausted to socialise. [rationalised]</p>

          <p class="formatted-text">But you saw through it.
And when I actually went to see some of them later and came back, discontent, smoking on the balcony, telling you how blasé and uninspiring it all felt - you asked me straight up:</p>

          <p class="formatted-text">- Do you think you’re better than them?</p>

          <p class="formatted-text">I flared up. Got defensive.</p>

          <p class="formatted-text">In retrospect:</p>

          <p class="formatted-text">- Hell yeah.</p>

          <p class="formatted-text">That became my last line of defense - to repel the real, experiential offensive against an identity that was already ripping at the seams. So I carved out a niche within it: the not like the other gaysTM. The narcissism of small differences. I thought I was some rebellious spirit. Gay, but not the regular gay. Not even the edgy art school gay. No, something worse. Something that’d make you wanna revoke the rights given to degenerates in the first place.</p>

          <p class="formatted-text">And honestly, that was fun.
Getting kicked out of gay clubs.
Ostracised from queer safe spaces.
That was fun.</p>

          <p class="formatted-text">The only people I could actually relate to, frankly even enjoy - were:</p>

          <p class="formatted-text">the prostitutes
(of which I eventually became one, in fact i became one with each of the types described in this paragraph),
the degenerates
and homeless,
the red light district creatures,
the pervs,
the junk tards.

The good stuff.</p>

          <p class="formatted-text">That was my descent into the psychopathia sexualis, as god intended, and as i would still strongly recommend, prescribe even, to any one reading this.</p>

          <p class="formatted-text">I finally felt like I was making friends. Friends who didn’t know my name or care about how my day went, sure, but who’d always help me score and enjoy the highs together. Here i restrain myself from tagging one of them, whom i met in Tbilisi, a child of pure juissancé, the lover of excess and extasy, my dear rededucted.</p>

          <p class="formatted-text">What more can you ask for?</p>

          <p class="formatted-text">I cant believe i am still typing this shit out, need a zyn.</p>

          <p class="formatted-text">One day bitch, i ll get my brain back, and get that blog going to really spill the t and tell my truth, till then, enjoy - mom, who thanks god cant read or hear, and others whom i met along the way, or forcefully added here :-*</p>

          <p class="formatted-text">Wait, what was i saying? I had a point still.</p>

          <p class="formatted-text">I lost the thread, something something, decent into the underworld, something something, identity crisis, smt smt acent, sobriety, whatever.</p>
