     Во имя Отца и Сына и Святого Духа, Аминь!

Я, [имя и фамилия], клянусь перед Господом Богом, Господом Сыном Иисусом Христом и Господом Духом Святым: клянусь перед хлебом этим, клянусь перед крестом этим, клянусь перед ножом этим и револьвером, что буду точно и полностью, безусловно исполнять все приказы Комитета, которые мне будут давать, которые идут на пользу нашего освобождения и объединения с Матушкой Сербией, под управлением Комитета.

Если я намеренно нарушу эту клятву, пусть меня Бог, Крест, Имя, Слава и хлеб судят, а нож и револьвер исполнят наказание.

Аминь!

      The first thing that drug addiction teaches psychoanalysis is that the object is a semblance, not a substance. It is precisely in drug addiction that we can find the most strongly sustained effort to incarnate the object of jouissance in an object of the world. It is precisely here that it may be verified that the object is semblance, and that on the horizon, the true object of jouissance—if that word means anything—is death.
(Laurent, 1998, p. 138)

          <p class="formatted-text">𝙷𝙰𝚁𝙳𝙱𝙰𝚉 𝒻𝓇𝑜𝓂 𝙳𝙾𝙽𝙱𝙰𝚉:
As some who engaged in incest (jerking off with step brother) this goes incredibly #hard</p>

          <p class="formatted-text">That incesident shaped my pubertal sexuality making me believe i was a fag depsite my attractions to girls prior, which never ceased throughout my life.</p>

          <p class="formatted-text">Caught in the cycle of shame, repression, and eventual "acceptance," I adopted a gay tm identity - which never fit*. Yet it was the only frame that made sense of the sexual trauma.</p>

          <p><strong>Comment section:</strong></p>

          <p class="formatted-text">Yeah, how come u were sucking and fucking men then if u werent a fag?</p>

          <p class="formatted-text">Part of it was cope, as i said. Another part was the effect of the early experience, molding libido like clay, hence dick gets hard. The silver lining of it all, is that I am able to experience sexuality across spectrum untamed and unrestrained, without capitulating and succumbing to the fake and delusional lifestyle of a gay,bi or any other pathological sexual id.</p>

          <p class="formatted-text">Sexual orientation is fake and gay on its own and a made up modern phenomena, there is only one orientation, aligned with nature, god or whatever u wanna name the source.</p>

          <p class="formatted-text">Desire is fluid, thruth aint.</p>

          <p class="formatted-text">In the words of my wife and other close friends who knew me in the midst of my trooning out:</p>

          <p class="formatted-text">- y cant u just be bi, u are clearly just getting back into the closet.</p>

          <p class="formatted-text">I may never be your hetero normie guyTM, slapping his wife and jugging bear with fellas after factory work. But what i can do is be #me (no matter how gay that sounds), and that my dear wife, means choosing not to engage and act upon those desires. Not out of shame, not out of fear but because by grace of god , the expansion of consciousness, i now i understand their origin.</p>

          <p class="formatted-text">U know me the best, remember how you pointed out to me, as we sat at some park, summer night, under trees:</p>

          <p class="formatted-text">- Look Vladimir, see those people? [A group of artsy faggots and trannies gathered for some photoshoot, some of whom i even knew].
Why don't you go play with the fags?</p>

          <p class="formatted-text">I instinctively felt, that you were right to encourage me, to come out of my shell. But i loathed the idea, couldn't see anything in them I could relate to, had zero interest in getting to know, let alone fucking any one of those pretencious arttards.</p>

          <p class="formatted-text">- I nah, i feel exhausted to socialise. [rationalised]</p>

          <p class="formatted-text">But you saw through it.
And when I actually went to see some of them later and came back, discontent, smoking on the balcony, telling you how blasé and uninspiring it all felt - you asked me straight up:</p>

          <p class="formatted-text">- Do you think you’re better than them?</p>

          <p class="formatted-text">I flared up. Got defensive.</p>

          <p class="formatted-text">In retrospect:</p>

          <p class="formatted-text">- Hell yeah.</p>

          <p class="formatted-text">That became my last line of defense - to repel the real, experiential offensive against an identity that was already ripping at the seams. So I carved out a niche within it: the not like the other gaysTM. The narcissism of small differences. I thought I was some rebellious spirit. Gay, but not the regular gay. Not even the edgy art school gay. No, something worse. Something that’d make you wanna revoke the rights given to degenerates in the first place.</p>

          <p class="formatted-text">And honestly, that was fun.
Getting kicked out of gay clubs.
Ostracised from queer safe spaces.
That was fun.</p>

          <p class="formatted-text">The only people I could actually relate to, frankly even enjoy - were:</p>

          <p class="formatted-text">the prostitutes
(of which I eventually became one, in fact i became one with each of the types described in this paragraph),
the degenerates
and homeless,
the red light district creatures,
the pervs,
the junk tards.

The good stuff.</p>

          <p class="formatted-text">That was my descent into the psychopathia sexualis, as god intended, and as i would still strongly recommend, prescribe even, to any one reading this.</p>

          <p class="formatted-text">I finally felt like I was making friends. Friends who didn’t know my name or care about how my day went, sure, but who’d always help me score and enjoy the highs together. Here i restrain myself from tagging one of them, whom i met in Tbilisi, a child of pure juissancé, the lover of excess and extasy, my dear rededucted.</p>

          <p class="formatted-text">What more can you ask for?</p>

          <p class="formatted-text">I cant believe i am still typing this shit out, need a zyn.</p>

          <p class="formatted-text">One day bitch, i ll get my brain back, and get that blog going to really spill the t and tell my truth, till then, enjoy - mom, who thanks god cant read or hear, and others whom i met along the way, or forcefully added here :-*</p>

          <p class="formatted-text">Wait, what was i saying? I had a point still.</p>

          <p class="formatted-text">I lost the thread, something something, decent into the underworld, something something, identity crisis, smt smt acent, sobriety, whatever.</p>
